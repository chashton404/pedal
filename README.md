# PEDAL

DISCLAIMER : This is not a completed project, it is currently a work in progress

## Huge Shoutout
I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the original creators of this repository for all that they did to make a game similar to Mario Kart running on the web using React and Three.js. It's really an amazing project.

## What did I do to this repo?
My step was to strip it down to the bear bones. I mostly just need the logic for kart and the models for the track and the Kart. I've removed several of the additional features like drifting, collision, and multiplayer compatability. With hopes of adding some of that again for the future.

## Why in the world would you do that?
Well aren't you just a nosey person? Jokes. My objective is to create a game that will connecto to my stationary bike trainer. That way I can hook my bike up to the internet and race on a track similar to MarioKart. Because I mean, how dope is that? 

## TO - DO
- [x] Get rid of drifing, multiplayer and collision logic
- [x] Create a basic straight track
- [x] Wire up a spline on the straight track that the Kart will follow
- [x] Get the Kart to follow the spline
- [ ] Add capability for bluetooth connection
- [ ] Add logic to determine speed based on the bike pedaling
- [ ] Switch the Kart model to be a bike
- [ ] and work up from there!
